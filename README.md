# DC32 trollbadge
## By rot13labs

The troll badge from DC32 trolls over wifi. By default the badge will scan for wifi networks and broadcast out any found SSIDs, performing a beacon attack.

Pressing the "Troll" button will force the troll badge to re-scan for wifi SSIDs to troll. Flipping the "perma-troll" switch will cause the badge to automatically re-scan every 30 seconds or so to ensure its trolling local networks in your location.

When the badge is connected over USB, you can create a serial connection to it using 9600 baud. This will allow you to acces the CTF on the badge, adjust debug mode, and enable various other wifi trolling modes.

### firmware

The troublemaker firmware I made for this badge is also included in this repo in case anyone wants to use/adjust/modify/steal/reuse it.
